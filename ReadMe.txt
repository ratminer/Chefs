The Table is the Monitor
The agent produces a String containing two ingredients and puts it onto the table.
The agent will wait until the table is empty again before it is allowed to put more ingredients.
The three chefs created in the main class will look at the table to see if their missing ingredients are there.
If the ingredients are there, then the chef will take them, leaving the table empty
allowing the agent to place another set of ingredients on the table.
